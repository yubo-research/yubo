# Bayesian optimization


- Can you do better than space-filling initialization?
  - Can you be purely stateless? (Sobol isn't, really)
  - Can you optimize each design instead of choosing an ad-hoc/arbitrary number of initialization points?
  
- Possible design methods
  - minimax dist
  - maximin dist
  - minimal integrated posterior variance
  - toroidal distance
  - action-space distance for RL problems; non-parameter distance/similarity in general (think of simulation optimization)

# Tasks for application
## show designs 
  - 2*2 four - point images
  - 3*3 nine - point images

## Present Q arms v.s. Batch
  e.g. batch =1, q = 10
       batch = 10, q = 1
    
## Plot noise/Dimension 

## Batch sampling in high dimensions
